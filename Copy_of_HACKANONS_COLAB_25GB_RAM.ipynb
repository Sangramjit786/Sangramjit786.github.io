After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyoncé's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyoncé's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.\"}, {'qas': [{'question': \"Which film featured Destiny's Child's first major single?\", 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90a9', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"For which song, did Destiny's Child take home the grammy award for best R&B performance?\", 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ab', 'answers': [{'text': '\"Say My Name\"', 'answer_start': 848}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Beyonce record with for the movie \"The Best Man?\"', 'id': '56be8c8a3aeaaa14008c90ac', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Beyonce's group changed their name to Destiny's Child in what year?\", 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9677', 'answers': [{'text': '1996', 'answer_start': 51}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"The name Destiny's Child was based on a quote in which book of the Bible?\", 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9678', 'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah', 'answer_start': 85}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Debut song, \"Killing Time\" was featured on what movie\\'s sound track?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c9679', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What song won Best R&B Performance in the 43 Annual Grammy Awards?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967a', 'answers': [{'text': 'Say My Name', 'answer_start': 849}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What singer did Beyonce record a song with for the movie, \\'\\'The Best Man\"?', 'id': '56bf7cb63aeaaa14008c967b', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Where did Destiny's Child get their name from?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830f9', 'answers': [{'text': 'Book of Isaiah.', 'answer_start': 85}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"Destiny's Child song, Killing Time, was included in which film's soundtrack?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fa', 'answers': [{'text': 'Men in Black.', 'answer_start': 215}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What was Destiny's Child's first major song hit?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fb', 'answers': [{'text': 'No, No, No', 'answer_start': 330}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"When did Destiny's Child release their second album?\", 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fc', 'answers': [{'text': '1999', 'answer_start': 688}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Beyoncé sing a duet with for \"The Best Man\" film?', 'id': '56d45fcb2ccc5a1400d830fd', 'answers': [{'text': 'Marc Nelson', 'answer_start': 1212}], 'is_impossible': False}], 'context': 'The group changed their name to Destiny\\'s Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.

              " 'A self-described \"modern-day feminist\", Beyoncé creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny\\'s Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award\\'s history. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium in 2011. Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014. Forbes magazine also listed her as the most powerful female musician of 2015.',\n",

              " \"All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his compositional style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.\",\n",

              " 'Chopin\\'s successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of Zdzisław Jachimecki, \"into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever.\" With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the November 1830 Uprising broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, \"I curse the moment of my departure.\" When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: \"Oh God! ... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!\" Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer\\'s maturing \"into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland.\"',\n",
              " \"Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.\",\n",
